## About

This game was created as part of a one-day family game jam ("Fam Jam") in April 2020. We started 
around 8AM and gave ourselves until 8PM to complete the game. 

The game was created with [Godot Engine](godotengine.org) v3.2.1. Other tools we used include
[LMMS](lmms.io),
[bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net/),
[Gimp](gimp.org), 
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), 
and 
[git](https://git-scm.com/).
